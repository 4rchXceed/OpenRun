- Allow scrolling though actions if too many to fit on screen
- Full-context AI mode
- Refactor the ui/ui.py and ui/ai.py to match code best practices (more OOP, less spaghetti code)
- Catch some errors
- Better logging in the webui (for now, there's only logging in the console)$
- More detailed registry monitoring (currently kinda crap)
- Better sessions management (ability to delete sessions, better naming, etc.)
